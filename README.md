# Filecoin Green Storage Providers Reporting Portal

As stated in the [Storage Providers Green Guidance Documentation](https://filecoin-green.gitbook.io/filecoin-green-documentation/), Filecoin Green is working on a comprehensive auditing process for all activity data, allowing SPs interested in making strong [sustainability claims](https://filecoin-green.gitbook.io/filecoin-green-documentation/readme-1/storage-providers-tiered-sustainability-claims) to publicly verify the associated data. 

We are now building a [Reporting Portal](https://filecoin-green.gitbook.io/filecoin-green-documentation/readme-1/additional-resources/annex-3-filecoin-green-reporting-portal), which is a solution that enables easy uploading of all relevant data to substantiate the configuration and performance of SPs operations.

We will update this repo periodically as we make more progress on the [Reporting Portal](https://filecoin-green.gitbook.io/filecoin-green-documentation/readme-1/additional-resources/annex-3-filecoin-green-reporting-portal).
